# cc-crab

uses Crab observation with ISGRI to find recommended minimal energy for imaging and spectral analysis.

It is built so that to input parameters (time), the notebook computes some output
that can be stored in a portable manner. This output includes the systematic needed
to fit the spectrum, the minimum valid energy etc.
